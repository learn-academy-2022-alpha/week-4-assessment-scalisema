# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are the arguments in Recat.

  Researched answer: Props are used to pass data to components in React. Props are short for properties. They are important because they allow react websites to be dynamic. Unlike state, props cannot be changed. 


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is when in a React website the JSX elements load/reload/update.

  Researched answer: DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. In simplier terms a DOM event happens when a website (useing React or someother framework that uses DOMs) needs to respond to a users actions such as clicking on a button or scrolling down the page. DOM events are normally used in combination with functions so that an event triggers a functions to run in responce to the event occuring.  An example of this is a user clicking a button.
  
  

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is programing where the developer relies on objects rather than hard code which is what fucational programing is based on. 

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming which is based around and focused on the use of objects.  Objects are data structures. Which means that they contain data which can come in several forms. Examples of data that can be contained within objects include fields () often known as attributes) and code (often known as methods). Conversly functional programming is a programming style that focuses on computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.  Unlike OOP funcational programming avoids the use of objects which feature changing-state and mutable data.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Floats have decimals and Intergers are "whole" numbers.

  Researched answer: In Ruby any number without a decimal is an Integer and any number with decimals is a Float.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: The return of a block of code?

  Researched answer: This means that Ruby returns a value of the last expression that was evaluated. Additionally this means that there is no need for return keys.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications. The latest major version is PostgreSQL 12.

3. Ruby on Rails:Ruby on Rails is an open-source software used to build web applications. Rails is a framework used to create websites using the general-purpose programming language Ruby. Ruby ranks amongst the top ten programming languages predominantly because of the voguishness of Rails.

4. ORM: this stands for Object-Relational Mapping and is a programming way to converting data between relational database, and object oriented programming language.

5. Active Record:An ORM that interacts with a database using a specific language. It it constantly putting data in objects to be recalled at a later time. It allows for large amounts of data to be recalled easily.
